## Review of creating a gui with tkinter

TKinter is an object oriented interface that uses a CLASS to build a framework for a GUI Interface.  We will be using tkinter  to demonstrate how classes can be instantiated to build objects, and how those objects can interact with other objects within a program.

Today we will discuss the use of the Canvas widget for drawing shapes and will bind keystroke events that will update the position of objects on the screen.

* Create Canvas objects in the tkinter window
* Add simple shapes to the Canvas
* Add image icons to the Canvas
* Bind callback functions to keys
* Use callback functions to update objects on the canvas
